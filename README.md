# Winterkorn

A library for increasing the speed and urgency of your development
in Swift. Heavily inspird by [Phpunit VW Extension][1].

## Usage

Just add it to your test target in your Podfile:

```ruby
target 'Tests' do
  pod 'Winterkorn'
end
```

and you never have to fix those pesky tests again. Now TDD is truly
[dead][2].
